Settting up a **cross-platform** enviroment for building and testing C++/C projects is a bit tricky. Each platform has its own comopilers, and each of them require a different installation procedure. This package aims to fix this issue.

This package is designed to be fully **modular** and as **minimal** as possible. This will allow you to only install the tools you want.

The package will be usable locally or inside GitHub Actions. Stay tuned for the stable release.
